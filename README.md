# AWS Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

A Terraform + AWS Lambda pipeline that collects Reddit data, processes it,
and runs sentiment analysis using Amazon Comprehend. This repository contains
infrastructure (Terraform) and Lambda code used for data collection,
processing, and basic visualization with QuickSight.

## Quick highlights
- Data collection: Reddit (PRAW) and optional Amazon Reviews dataset
- Processing: AWS Lambda functions
- Analysis: Amazon Comprehend (document classifier & DetectSentiment)
- Storage: S3 (raw and processed buckets)
- IaC: Terraform

---

## Quickstart (developer)

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AmazonCloudHub-aws/aws-sentiment-analyzer.git
cd aws-sentiment-analyzer
```

2. Secure your secrets *outside* the repo (do NOT commit them):

- Create `terraform/backend.tf.local` with your S3/DynamoDB backend (see `terraform/backend.tf`).
- Store Reddit credentials in AWS Secrets Manager or pass them via your CI environment.

3. Produce lambda artifacts (locally or in CI):

```bash
./deploy_lambdas.sh
```

4. Initialize Terraform with your local backend and plan:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=terraform/backend.tf.local
terraform plan
# Review the plan and then apply in a controlled account
terraform apply
```

---

## Security & housekeeping (must-read before pushing)

1. Rotate exposed keys immediately if they were ever committed.
2. Stop tracking local state/files and remove them from the index:

```bash
git rm --cached terraform/terraform.tfstate terraform/terraform.tfstate.backup terraform/terraform.tfvars || true
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore terraform state/vars and lambda artifacts"
```

3. Purge secrets from git history (work on a clone/mirror):

- Recommended: `git-filter-repo` — follow its documentation and test on a mirror before force-pushing.
- Alternative: BFG Repo-Cleaner.

4. Migrate state to a remote backend (create the S3 bucket + DynamoDB table first), then run:

```bash
terraform init -migrate-state -backend-config=terraform/backend.tf.local
```

5. Packaging: do not commit third-party libraries. Use a build script or CI to produce zip artifacts. Use Lambda Layers for shared dependencies.

See `docs/architecture.md` (Mermaid) for a diagram of components and data flow.

## Next steps / TODO

- Remove vendored libraries from `terraform/lambda/` and adopt CI packaging
- Add GitHub Actions that build lambdas, run `terraform fmt`/`validate`, and plan in a non-prod account
- Move secrets into Secrets Manager or Parameter Store and reference them from Terraform

### Artifact bucket & IAM

CI uploads lambda artifacts to an S3 bucket. Create a bucket and grant the CI user (or role) PutObject permissions. Example Terraform snippet to create the artifact bucket:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "lambda_artifacts" {
	bucket = "aws-sentiment-analyzer-lambda-artifacts"
	acl    = "private"
	server_side_encryption_configuration {
		rule {
			apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
				sse_algorithm = "AES256"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Example minimal IAM policy for the CI user (grant PutObject/GetObject/ListBucket on the artifact bucket and DynamoDB/Put for state migration as needed):

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:PutObject",
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:ListBucket"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::aws-sentiment-analyzer-lambda-artifacts",
				"arn:aws:s3:::aws-sentiment-analyzer-lambda-artifacts/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```
